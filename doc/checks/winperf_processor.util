description:
 This check monitors the CPU utilization on a Windows system using the
 windows performance counters (agent section {<<<winperf_processor>>>}).
 This check replaces {winperf.cpuusage} which is outdated since version {1.1.11i1}

 Setting a level for warning or a critical state is possible, but might
 not be very usefull, since the computed value is an average over
 just one check cycle. A combination with a larger value of {max_check_attempts}
 or {notification_delay} might be useful here.

perfdata:
 The averaged percentage of CPU utilization during the last check cycle.

inventory:
 A check of this type is automatically created for all Windows
 hosts.

[parameters]
warning (int): The percentage of CPU usage that triggers
 a WARNING state
critical (int): The percentage of CPU usage that triggers
 a CRITICAL state

[configuration]
winperf_cpu_default_levels (int, int): Default levels warning and critical
