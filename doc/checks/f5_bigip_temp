description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic managers) for the
 status of the builtin fans. It will alert if the temperature levels rise above a "normal" level that is set according to the average of the systems we had data on.

 It supports devices running the 9.0 and above releases of the F5 OS. It's tested against 9.3
 devices.



inventory:
 The check gathers a list of internal hardware sensors.
 It labels them as either chassis or CPU sensors.


perfdata:
 It generates performance data for the current, warning and critical temperaturs and graphs those.
