description:
 This check measures the usage of physical RAM and virtual memory
 using the {HOST-RESOURCES-MIB}, which is provided by many SNMP
 agents (especially those on standard operating systems).

 The logic used for monitoring is exactly the same as in the
 agent based check {mem.used}. Please refer to the man page
 of that check for details.

inventory:
 If the needed information is available via SNMP one service
 for the target host will be created.

perfdata:
 Three variables: the physical RAM, the virtual memory and the
 sum of both.

[parameters]
warning (int or float): the precentage of virtual memory used
 by processes at which WARNING state is triggered. If the
 level is defined as an integer value then it is interpreted
 as an absolute value in megabytes.
critical (int or float): the percentage or absolute value
 at which CRITICAL state is triggered

[configuration]
memused_default_levels (float, float): Levels used by
 all checks that are created by inventory.
