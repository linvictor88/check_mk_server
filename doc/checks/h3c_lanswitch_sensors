title: Check CPU Utilization of 3COM and H3C switches.

description:

 This Check queries the CPU utilization for various switches made by 3Com
 and H3C, either standalone or that of the CPUs of all units in the stack. By
 default it will handle 3com Superstack 4 switches, but it should work with
 all devices defined in the "Lsw" lanswitch Mibs.

 Please note: some of these switches don't handle SNMP well and might generate
 up to 90% CPU load while queried.  To accomodate for this you should lower
 the frequency of SNMP based checks with them.  The CPU usage ratio returned
 by the check is the average load of the last 60 seconds.

inventory:
 The check will add one service per Unit/CPU in a stack.

[parameters]
warning (int): the percentage of 1-minute average load at which the switch is considered too busy.

critical (int): the percentage of 1-minute average load at which the switch is considered overloaded.


[configuration]
superstack4_cpu_default_levels (int, int): the warn and critical levels for the checkl.
 They are set to default to 50% for "WARN" and 75% for "CRIT".


item:
 The CPU found by inventory (it's OID is a multiple of 65536 and will be divided to come to a sane value)


perfdata:
 It does not generate any performance data yet.
