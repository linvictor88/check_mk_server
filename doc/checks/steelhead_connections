description:
 This check measures the current number of connections on a Riverbed
 Steelhead appliance. The total number of connections is first split
 up into {optimized} and {passthrough}. The optimized connections
 are divided into {active}, {established}, {half opened} and {half closed}.

 Currently there is no way to apply levels and the check is always {OK}.


perfdata:
 Five values: {active}: the number of currently active connections (optimized),
 {established}: the number of established connections (optimized), {halfOpened}:
 the number of half opened connections (optimized), {halfClosed}: the number
 of half closed connections (optimizied), {passthrough}: the number of unoptimized
 connections. The total number and the number of optimized connections can be computed
 from these values by simple additions.

inventory:
 One service per Riverbed Steelhead appliance will be created.
