description:
 This check verifies the present-, health- and power-state of a blade in an
 IBM blade center.

 The check raises {CRITICAL} and {WARNING} states depending on the different states:
 When a blade does not exist anymore the check becomes {CRITICAL}, when a blade has
 been turned off the check becomes {WARNING} and when the health state of the blade
 is reported as not ok it raises {WARNING} or {CRITICAL} depending on the severity.

item:
 Number of the blade (as string, not int).

examples:
 checks += [
  ( "hostabc", "blade_bays", "8", None)
 ]

inventory:
 All blades in the system with the state 1 (present) are automatically
 inventorized.
