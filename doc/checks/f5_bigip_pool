description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic managers) for the
 status of any load balancing pools. It gathers the number of loadbalancers backing the pool
 and how many of those are working. It doesn't currently honor the 'MinUpMembers' parameter
 that can be set to trigger actions for the pool if too many members fail.

 It supports devices running the 9.0 and above releases of the F5 OS. It's tested against 9.3
 devices.

examples:
 # Let the Pool named ABC on your first F5 be in WARNING state when it reaches 5 active members or in CRITICAL for anything between 3 and 0.
 check_parameters += [
 ( (5, 3), [ "f5-1" ], [ "Load Balancing Pool Pool_ABC" ]),
 ]


inventory:
 The check gather a list of the pools defined on a system. It will include non-enabled ones,
 as this is considered a temporary state.

[parameters]
warning (int): Issue a warning if there's this many or less members left in a load balancing pool
crit (int): Go to critical state if there's this many members left in a load balancing pool. Note: 0 active members will always result in a critical state.

[configuration]
f5_bigip_pool_default_levels = (int, int): The default levels for all F5 BIG-IP pool checks. This is preset to {(2, 1)}.



perfdata:
 the check does not (yet) generate performance data.
