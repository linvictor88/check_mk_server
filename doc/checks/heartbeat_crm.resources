description:
 This check uses the output of the {crm_mon} command as sent by the Check_MK
 linux agent. The check uses the information about the nodes and resources in
 the command output.

 The check will report a CRITICAL state when the reported state is not {Started}.
 In addition the check can report a problem if a ressource is not handled
 by a specified node.

inventory:
 On each node one service for each resource group or resource will be created.
 If {heartbeat_crm_resources_naildown} is set to {True}, then for each resource
 the current node of that resource is hardcoded as target parameter and will
 be checked in future.

[parameters]
node (string): The expected node to handle this resource. When set to {None},
 then the node will not be checked, only the resource state.

[configuration]
heartbeat_crm_resources_naildown (bool): Naildown the resources to the nodes
 which care about the resources during the inventory run.
