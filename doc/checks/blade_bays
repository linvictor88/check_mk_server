 check goes into warning state. Any other bay status results
 in a critical check result.

 A string with the format "PD{A} {B}" where {A} is the number
 of the power domain (1 or 2) and {B} is the name of the bay
 (e.g. {Midplane}).

inventory:
 All bays with the state 1 (present and OK) are automatically
 inventorized.
