description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic managers) to identify
 if all system configs are in-sync when running a load balancing cluster.
 It will issue a warning if one of the nodes is out of sync, or a critical on one of the two following conditions:
     - both nodes have differing configs
     - the node being checked has the status "unconfigured"


 It supports devices running the 9.0 and above releases of the F5 OS. It's tested against 9.3
 devices.



inventory:
  One service is defined for the cluster status unless the load balancer config sync is in a status of "unconfigured"


perfdata:
 the check does not (yet) generate performance data.
