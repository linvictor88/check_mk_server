description:
 This check measures the CPU utilization during the last check
 cycle. A level can be set only on {wait} (disk wait). If you
 want to set levels on your CPU usage you better use the check
 {cpu.loads}.

perfdata:
 Three variables: The percentage of time spent in {user}, {system} and {wait}
 (disk wait). The idle time can be computed by substracting those three values
 from 100%. The user value contains also {nice}.

inventory:
 One check per host is created if the agent contains a {kernel}
 section containing cpu information. The inventory creates the
 check with the parameter {kernel_util_default_levels}, which is
 preset to {None} thus imposing no levels and making the check always OK.

[parameters]
warning (int): The percentage of {wait} that triggers a warning level.
critical (int): The percentage of {wait} that triggers a critical level
 The parameters may also be set to {None}, which makes the check alwas {OK}.

[configuration]
kernel_util_default_levels (int, int): Default levels used by inventorized
  checks. This is present to {None}, which disables the levels.
